# BAGO Traceability

Traceability is file-manifest based in this snapshot.

## Authorities

- `release_version.txt`
- `versions.json` (derived compatibility index; not version authority)
- `scripts/package_v4.py`
- `current.manifest.json`
- `current.sha256`

## Rules

- public claims need a command, evidence bundle, or contract proof
- historical one-off material stays out of generated packages
- package contents must match the manifest
