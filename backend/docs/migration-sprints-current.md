# HISTORICAL — BAGO Migration Sprint Record

Status: completed historical record
Scope: migration slices retained in this repository
Historical source: `BAGO_MIGRATE_TARGET.md` (former external migration target)

> This completed record is not a current migration plan. Its former external

> The source name above preserves provenance; it is not a current dependency.

This contract records the current-tree migration slices that are already reflected in the active system.
